# GiGi Yoghurt - Premium Single-Page Website

This is the **premium HTML + Tailwind + JavaScript** single-page site for GiGi Yoghurt.
Files:
- `index.html` â€” main site (Tailwind CDN used; no build step required)
- Images are loaded from Unsplash (external URLs)

How to use:
1. Download and unzip.
2. Open `index.html` in a browser to preview locally.
3. To deploy: push this folder to GitHub and connect the repository to Vercel or drag-and-drop to Netlify/Vercel.

For production:
- Replace CDN Tailwind with a proper Tailwind build and purge unused CSS.
- Configure a backend for contact forms and orders (serverless functions or API).
- Optimize images and host them on a CDN.
